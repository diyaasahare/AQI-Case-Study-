# AQI-Case-Study-
This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data to identify pollution trends and key contributing pollutants. Performed EDA, data preprocessing, and built a regression model to predict AQI levels. The goal is to support environmental monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) levels using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The objective is to understand pollution trends, identify major contributing pollutants, and build a predictive model that can forecast AQI levels to support environmental monitoring and public health awareness.

Air pollution is a critical environmental challenge, especially in urban regions. This case study demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be used to derive meaningful insights and assist in decision-making.

Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on AQI dataset

Identify key pollutants affecting AQI

Analyze seasonal and temporal trends

Build a Machine Learning model to predict AQI

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

Visualize insights using dashboards and plots

 Dataset Description

The dataset includes pollutant concentration values such as:
